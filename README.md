In my final semester at BU, I took a class on artificial intelligence taught by Eric Breck, a software engineer at Google's Cambridge office. For this assignment, I programmed the AI for a Wumpus World (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus) agent. 

The wumpusworld.py file is where the agent's AI can be found. The logic.py, logic_440.py, and utils.py files contain tools and functions written by Eric. The test_wumpusworld.py file contains some test cases.

To see the code in action, simply run either wumpusworld.py or test_wumpusworld.py.
